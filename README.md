# Neural-Network-Based-Adaptive-Handwriting-Recognition-and-Rehabilitation-System-for-Dysgraphia
Dysgraphia and motor impairments significantly affect an individual's ability to produce legible handwriting, impacting academic, professional, and personal life. Traditional handwriting recognition systems are ill-equipped to handle the non-standard, irregular patterns exhibited by individuals with these conditions. This report details the development of an innovative AI-driven system designed to accurately recognize and analyze handwriting patterns, diagnose dysgraphia, and provide personalized rehabilitation. By leveraging neural networks and adaptive learning, this system aims to offer a robust, accessible, and effective solution for individuals with handwriting challenges. The provided code demonstrates a basic implementation of this concept, showcasing image preprocessing, OCR extraction, and a simple CNN for dysgraphia classification.
